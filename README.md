### 1. Compilation instructions

Compiling this program is pretty simple, as it uses `make` in order to compile, and link all of the source code, and the
libraries.

So please ensure you have the standard build tools installed on your system.
On a Debian distro of linux, this can be done using the command:

`$ sudo apt-get install build-essential`

Once you have this all installed (chances are, it already is), you can crack on with compiling this script.

I have provided (as per the spec), a simple bash script that will do this for you, simply run:

`$ ./compileSim`

From the root directory.
This will generate an executable library called `runSimulation`.
